    <h3>MY FIRST LOVE</h3>
<p>Looking at the starry night canvas, sprawling darkness, except for a splatter of firefly-speckles and the moon being the brightest it could be. Beautiful, yes, but the night is just cold and lonely without you. It started off at a tender young age, our irreplacable friendship. From playing house to bringing me out on friendly dates, we've grown up and so did my feelings for you. I would have never expected this nor did I wish for it, but one can't control feelings and now I don't only love you as a friend, but also as a woman who dreams to be your lover and one day spend a lifetime with you. You've always been there for me, through thick and thin. You've watched all of my ballet recitals and cheered me on on my tournaments, you were my #1 fan, my supporter in life. You know me so well, from my favorites to things that I'm intolerable with. You know when I'm upset or happy even without me telling you, and you would be there for me though good and bad times. You were my to-go-to person during my darkest hours, you were the moon of my night sky. At times, you would surprise me by coming to my house and bringing me out for a drive to enjoy the silence of a chilly night yet it's one of the warmest moments I ever had and wasn't completely silent due to my beating heart. Now, I just look at the photos that holds our memories together since we can't make new ones anymore. You're gone. It took me a long time to accept that I won't be able to see the cutie who holds a banner he personally made and cheers loudly to support me as I chase my passion, who cooks for me when I'm hungry, brings me to places when I'm lonely, stays with me when I'm sad, calms me down when I'm mad, and shows me the beautiful side of everything in this world beyond the ugliness that the society shows. That person is no more on the grounds I walk on, and now I wish he is happy, wherever he is, as I look up at the night sky. Thank you for all the memories but now, I am ready to let you go, my bestfriend, my #1 fan, my dearest first love. </p>

<h3>THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE</h3>
<p>My dependable source of comfort; my cushion when I fall, so gentle yet so strong. Mom, You're a wonderful mother. Carrying me in your womb for 9 months and the suffering and pain of labor you went through just to bring me to this world, thank you mommy. You taught me right from wrong and raised me with love and care which pushed me to do the same to others. My life is simpler, better, and richer. You are always the guiding light of life, pushing me to do the right thing even when it was hard to do. "Mother" is such a simple term but to me, its meaning is deeper than it shows. It pierces through the heart of a child who looks up to her mother, her idol in life. After all, you are an inspiration in my life as I continue to follow your footsteps. I am the person I am today because you let me be. Your unconditional love made me a happy, strong, and secure individual who exudes confidence and maturity to my peers. You, who always cared, always protected me, and who was always there for me no matter what for that I would always be thankful. I am blessed to have you as my mother, I am open with you with almost everything because you had always made me feel accepted in your loving eyes and arms. I love you more than you know and I hope I could express it well to let you feel how much I love and appreciate you. In all the world, there is no mother better than my own in my heart and eyes. You're the best and wisest person I have ever known. My heart is filled with love for you, my teacher, my bestfriend, my beautiful and loving mother.</p>

<h3>LOVE ONESELF</h3>
<p>Many moments in life that I wish I was prettier, that I was taller, that I have the right curves instead of being flat. Maybe then someone will pick me and that someone is you. But now I realize I do not need to change who I am for someone to love me. People will love me because of who I am, flaws and all. Love is not a competition that I can win just because I am better. Love is something you fight for but not something you should compete for. Love should not be something I chase and force to have. I learned that before loving others wholeheartedly, I should first learn how to love myself. In the journey of loving myself, I realized my value and worth. It helped me realize what I want and need, the love that I deserve. This empowered me to become a better individual with a strong and capable heart which won't easily be broken down, empty, and lost like the last time I lost you. I have gained and lost, loved and was abandoned, trusted and was deceived. I got gurt, yes, but it made me stronger, wiser, and courageous. The person in me wanted to be happy, to be rediscovered, to be truly renewed. I wanted to be a better version of me, to see the good in the bad in any situation. Loving myself is a lifetime process but as I do so, it also taught me to love others better and more sincerely than ever before. After all, before being able to love someone and be loved by someone else, I need to love myself first. I need to be my priority and my soulmate. I need to embrace who I am, with all my flaws, scars, quirks, mistakes, and dreams. I need to learn how to see my value, and then I'll be able to identify what I want and how I deserve to be treated. This is me realizing what I deserve, remembering my self-worth. I deserve someone who will love me in my entirety but for now, that someone should be me.</p>
